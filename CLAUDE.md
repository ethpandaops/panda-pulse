## Quick Reference

### Core Components
- **Service**: Main application orchestration (`pkg/service/`)
- **Analyzer**: Health check processing (`pkg/analyzer/`)
- **Cartographoor**: Client management (`pkg/cartographoor/`)
- **Checks**: Health check implementations (`pkg/checks/`)
- **Discord Bot**: Discord integration (`pkg/discord/`)
- **Store**: Data persistence with S3 (`pkg/store/`)

### Key Technologies
- Go 1.24 with standard library patterns
- Discord Bot API for user interaction
- Grafana/Prometheus for metrics collection
- AWS S3 for data storage
- Docker for containerization

### Environment Variables
Essential configuration via environment variables:
- `GRAFANA_SERVICE_TOKEN`: Grafana API access
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Discord bot authentication
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: S3 access
- `S3_BUCKET`: Storage bucket name

### Testing
- Run tests: `go test ./...`
- Integration tests use testcontainers
- Mocks generated with uber-go/mock
- Local development with localstack for S3
