# panda-pulse üêº

A monitoring tool for Ethereum networks that checks node health and reports issues to Discord.

The checks are run against a Grafana instance, which is configured with a Prometheus datasource. The checks themselves are rather specific to the custom Prometheus metrics ethPandaOps has setup, so your mileage may vary as a public user.

## Usage

### Pulse Check

Run by passing in a network name, a discord channel ID and one of `--ethereum-cl` or `--ethereum-el`.

```bash
docker run -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_TOKEN=your_token \
          -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token \
          -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=optional_key \
          ethpandaops/panda-pulse:latest \
          --discord-channel CHANNEL_ID \
          --network NETWORK_NAME \
          --ethereum-cl CLIENT_NAME
```
