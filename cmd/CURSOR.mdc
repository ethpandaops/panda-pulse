# CMD Component

Application entry point that bootstraps the panda-pulse monitoring service with Cobra CLI.

## Key Patterns
- Single main.go entry point with cobra.Command structure
- Environment variable configuration binding in setConfig()
- Graceful shutdown with context cancellation and signal handling
- Service lifecycle management (create, start, stop) with proper error handling

## Configuration Management
- All configuration sourced from environment variables
- Sensible defaults applied after env loading (Grafana URL, Prometheus datasource, S3 region/prefix)
- Configuration validation before service startup with descriptive error messages

## Shutdown Behavior
- 30-second shutdown timeout for graceful service termination
- Signal handling for SIGINT/SIGTERM with proper cleanup
- Context-based shutdown coordination across all service components
