# Queue Component

Generic concurrent queue system that processes MonitorAlert items with built-in deduplication and comprehensive metrics tracking.

## Key Integration Patterns

- **Generic Queue Design**: Uses Go generics to support type-safe queue operations for any item type
- **Deduplication via Sync.Map**: Prevents duplicate processing of items using network-client key combinations
- **Prometheus Metrics Integration**: Comprehensive metrics for queue length, processing time, failures, and skip counts
- **Worker Function Pattern**: Configurable worker functions that return success/error status for flexible processing

## Important Constraints

- **Single Item Processing**: Only one item per network-client combination can be processed at a time
- **Bounded Queue**: Fixed buffer size of 100 items to prevent memory issues
- **Context-Based Lifecycle**: Queue processing respects context cancellation for graceful shutdown
