# Clients Component

Central registry for Ethereum client types and team mappings used across the monitoring system.

## Key Patterns
- **Client Type System**: Use ClientType enum for consensus/execution layer differentiation
- **Team Role Mapping**: TeamRoles map connects client names to Discord team roles for notifications
- **Pre-production Tracking**: PreProductionClients map identifies development/testing clients
- **Build Configuration**: ClientsWithBuildArgs defines clients requiring special build parameters

## Important Constraints
- Client names in maps must match exactly with discovery system identifiers
- Discord role names must correspond to actual server roles for proper notifications
- Pre-production flag affects alert routing and severity levels
