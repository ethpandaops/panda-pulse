# HTTP Client Component

Instrumented HTTP client wrapper that provides automatic metrics collection and structured logging for API requests.

## Key Patterns

### Wrapper Pattern
- Use ClientWrapper for high-level HTTP operations with automatic metrics
- Use MetricsRoundTripper for low-level transport-level instrumentation
- Always provide service and operation labels for proper metrics categorization

### Error Handling
- Special case handling for expected errors (e.g., Hive 404s return nil without logging)
- Structured error logging with request context (URL, method, duration, status)
- Automatic metrics recording for both network errors and HTTP status errors

### Metrics Integration
- Record request counts, error counts, and duration histograms
- Use service/operation labels for proper segmentation
- Register metrics with Prometheus at initialization
