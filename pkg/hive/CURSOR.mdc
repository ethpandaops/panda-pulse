# Hive Integration Component

Ethereum test coverage integration that fetches test results and captures visual snapshots from Hive test infrastructure.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Uses HTTP client with configurable timeout for API requests
- Implements headless Chrome via chromedp for screenshot capture
- Maps internal client/network names to Hive's naming conventions
- Filters test results to latest runs per client/test type

## Important Constraints
- Screenshot capture requires chromedp browser context with mobile viewport
- Network and client name mapping is essential for proper Hive API interaction
- Test result processing must handle JSONL format with timestamp extraction
- Always validate snapshot configuration before browser operations
