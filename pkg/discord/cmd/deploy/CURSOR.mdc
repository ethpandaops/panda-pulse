# Deploy Command Component

Discord slash command that handles deployment of Docker images to Ethereum network nodes via SSH.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **SSH-Based Deployment**: Uses SSH to connect to network nodes for Docker container management
- **Concurrent Operations**: Deploys to multiple nodes simultaneously with progress tracking
- **Inventory-Based Filtering**: Fetches network inventory from API to determine target nodes

## Important Constraints
- **Admin-Only Access**: Deploy command is restricted to admin roles only due to security implications
- **Progress Reporting**: Long-running deployments provide regular Discord message updates
- **Error Resilience**: Individual node failures don't stop deployment to other nodes
