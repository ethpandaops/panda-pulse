# Discord Checks Command

Discord slash command implementation for managing Ethereum network health checks and alerts.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Subcommand Pattern**: Implements run, register, deregister, list, and debug subcommands under /checks
- **Queue-Driven Execution**: Uses AlertQueue for asynchronous check execution with proper error handling
- **Thread-Based Reporting**: Creates Discord threads for detailed issue reporting with categorized results

## Important Constraints
- **Channel Restrictions**: Registration only allowed in "bots" or "monitoring" category channels
- **Cron Validation**: All schedules must be valid cron expressions with proper parsing
- **Infrastructure Filtering**: Skips notifications for infrastructure-only issues to reduce noise
