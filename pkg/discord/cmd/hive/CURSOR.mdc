# Hive Discord Command

Discord slash command for managing Hive test summary alerts and on-demand execution.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Subcommand Structure**: Uses Discord subcommands (register, deregister, list, run) within single `/hive` command
- **Scheduled Execution**: Integrates with scheduler service to run periodic Hive summary checks via cron expressions
- **Comparison Logic**: Compares current test results with previous summaries to detect changes in Ethereum client behavior

## Important Constraints
- **Network Validation**: All operations require checking Hive availability for the specified network before execution
- **Storage Integration**: Uses HiveSummaryRepo for persistence and comparison with previous test results
- **Discord Threading**: Creates threaded conversations for detailed test result discussions with auto-archive
