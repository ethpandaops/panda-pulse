# Discord Command Common

Shared types and utilities for Discord slash commands that handle role-based authorization and bot context access.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Command Interface**: All Discord commands must implement the `Command` interface with Name(), Register(), and Handle() methods
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Use `HasPermission()` function to validate user access with admin/client team roles
- **Centralized Bot Context**: Commands access services through the `BotContext` interface rather than direct dependencies

## Important Constraints
- **Permission Validation**: Always check permissions before command execution using role configuration
- **Client-Specific Access**: Team members can only access commands for their assigned client networks
- **Admin Override**: Admin roles have full access to all commands regardless of client restrictions
