# Discord Mentions Command

Discord slash command for managing client team mention configurations for network monitoring alerts.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Guild-Scoped Storage**: All mentions are stored per Discord guild (server) to allow multi-server deployments
- **Network-Client Scoping**: Mentions are organized by network-client pairs for granular team notification control
- **Ephemeral Responses**: All command responses use ephemeral flags to keep channel clean

## Important Constraints
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Add operations automatically prevent duplicate mentions in the storage layer
- **Graceful Fallback**: List operations resolve Discord IDs to readable names but fall back to raw IDs if resolution fails
- **Atomic Updates**: All persistence operations update the `UpdatedAt` timestamp for audit tracking
