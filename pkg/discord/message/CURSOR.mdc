# Discord Message Builder

Generates structured Discord alert messages for Ethereum network monitoring alerts with categorized instance lists and rich embeds.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Builder Pattern**: AlertMessageBuilder constructs complex Discord messages through incremental build methods
- **Categorization Logic**: Intelligently categorizes failed instances as regular, infrastructure issues, or unrelated based on root cause analysis
- **Infrastructure Health Checks**: Validates SSH connectivity to determine if failures are infrastructure-related vs client-related

## Important Constraints
- **Message Size Limits**: Discord has strict message size limits requiring content to be split across multiple messages and threads
- **Instance Classification**: Must correctly identify pre-production clients and root cause patterns to avoid false positives
- **Thread Management**: Main alerts with detailed breakdowns in thread messages for better organization
