# Discord Bot Component

Discord bot integration that provides slash command interface for Ethereum network monitoring management.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Command Pattern**: All Discord commands implement the `common.Command` interface with registration and handling
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Commands are protected by role-based access control using Discord server roles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses Discord interaction events to trigger monitoring operations via queues

## Important Constraints  
- **Permission Validation**: All commands except build triggers require permission checks before execution
- **Metrics Collection**: Every command execution is tracked with Prometheus metrics including duration and error rates
- **Queue Integration**: Commands operate through queues rather than direct execution for better resilience
