# Grafana Mock

Generated GoMock implementation for Grafana client interface testing.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Auto-generated mock using uber-go/mock with gomock.Controller
- Implements full Grafana Client interface for unit testing
- Uses expectation-based testing pattern with EXPECT() recorder

## Important Constraints
- DO NOT manually edit generated mock files - regenerate using mockgen
- Always use gomock.Controller in test setup for mock lifecycle management
- Mock expectations must be set before calling mocked methods
