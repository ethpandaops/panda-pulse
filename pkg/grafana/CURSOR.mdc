# Grafana Client

HTTP client for Grafana API queries with Prometheus datasource integration.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Uses Bearer token authentication with configurable datasource UID
- Implements query interface for Prometheus metric queries via Grafana API
- Supports HTTP client injection for metrics tracking and testing

## Important Constraints
- Hardcoded query parameters (1 data point, 1m interval, 5m time range)
- Fixed refID "pandaPulse" and legend format for all queries
- Always uses POST requests to `/api/ds/query` endpoint
