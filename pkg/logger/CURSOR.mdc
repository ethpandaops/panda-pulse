# Logger Component

Specialized logging component that captures logs from individual health check runs with buffered output.

## Key Design Patterns
- **Buffered Logging**: Uses bytes.Buffer to capture log output for later retrieval
- **Check-Scoped**: Each CheckLogger instance is tied to a specific check run ID
- **Standard Log Format**: Uses Go's standard log package with timestamps
- **Memory-Based**: Logs are kept in memory buffer, not written to files

## Important Constraints
- Logs are ephemeral - only exist during check execution lifecycle
- Must use GetBuffer() to retrieve captured log content
- Always include check ID for traceability
