# Service Component

Main application orchestrator that manages component lifecycle and configuration.

## Key Patterns
- **Service Orchestration**: Coordinates all major components (scheduler, bot, stores, cartographoor)
- **Configuration Management**: Centralizes config validation and transforms into component-specific configs
- **Lifecycle Management**: Handles graceful startup/shutdown with proper ordering of component initialization
- **HTTP Server Management**: Runs separate health and metrics servers with configured timeouts

## Important Constraints
- Components must be started in correct order (S3 connection verification before everything else)
- All services must support graceful shutdown via context cancellation
- Configuration validation happens at startup - fail fast on missing required env vars
- Health and metrics endpoints use separate HTTP servers for isolation
