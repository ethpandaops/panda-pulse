# Scheduler Component

Cron-based job scheduling system with integrated Prometheus metrics and error handling.

## Key Patterns

- **Thread-safe Operations**: All job management operations use mutex protection for concurrent access
- **Job Replacement**: Adding a job with existing name automatically replaces the previous job  
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks executions, failures, timing, and active job counts via Prometheus
- **Context-aware Execution**: All job functions receive context for cancellation and timeouts

## Important Constraints

- Jobs are identified by name - duplicate names will replace existing jobs
- All metrics must be properly registered at startup to avoid panics
- Test isolation requires resetting Prometheus registry between tests
