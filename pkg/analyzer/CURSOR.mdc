# Analyzer Component

Health check analysis engine that identifies root causes and unexplained issues in Ethereum client pairs.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Stateful analysis using multi-step pipeline approach
- Client pair abstraction (CL-EL combinations) for failure correlation
- Root cause detection with primary/secondary classification
- False positive removal for pre-production clients

## Critical Design Constraints  
- Minimum failure threshold (MinFailuresForRootCause = 2) for root cause classification
- Pre-production client handling with special exemptions
- Target client filtering for focused analysis scope
