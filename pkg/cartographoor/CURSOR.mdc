# Cartographoor Service

Client and network metadata management service that fetches and caches data from remote cartographoor API.

## Core Functionality
- Maintains client metadata (repositories, versions, logos, types)
- Filters networks to only include devnets
- Thread-safe access with automatic periodic updates
- Integrates with static client configuration data

## Key Constraints
- All network operations are filtered to devnet-only
- Uses read-write mutex for thread safety with high-frequency read access
- Combines remote API data with local static client configuration
