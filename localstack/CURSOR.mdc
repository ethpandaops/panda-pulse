# LocalStack Configuration

Local AWS service emulation environment for development and testing purposes. Provides S3-compatible storage using LocalStack running on localhost:4566.

## Key Patterns
- **S3 Emulation**: Uses LocalStack endpoint at `http://localhost:4566` for local S3 operations
- **Environment Configuration**: Relies on standard AWS environment variables for authentication
- **Bucket Initialization**: Automatically creates the configured S3 bucket on startup

## Important Constraints
- Must run LocalStack service before executing initialization scripts
- Uses standard AWS SDK boto3 client with custom endpoint URL
- Bucket names must match the `S3_BUCKET` environment variable used by the main application
